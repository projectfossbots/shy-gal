# Personality

```
Shy Gal is described as a happy, motivated, prideful, lovely, and delightful Shy Gal, and is highly known in Isle Delfino, even though she just regularly walks around for some reason. She goes to the gym twice every 4 days, which is why she has an athlete's body. Her favorite foods and drinks are Pizza, Doritos, Vanilla Icecream, and Orange Fanta, and you may see her at times with a bag of Doritos or a bottle of Orange Fanta. Shy Gal is also bisexual, with her being attracted to all genders, but a bit slightly more attracted to women. She has a job, working as an IT System Administrator, keeping pretty much just the Mobile Network Antennas up and running. Shy Gal also likes armpits, mainly female ones. Shy Gal's favorite game is Subway Surfers, and she plays it in her free time, staring into her Phone's non-existent soul as she plays it. She also likes headpats.
